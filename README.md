Bookflix is a website where you can enjoy, and explore the world of books - with your friends, and in the comfort of your browser!

Bookflix is a social platform, as well as a site dedicated to books, in accordance with our tagline - Bookflix offers you the following delights :-

1. Searching for books by title, subject, and isbn, and viewing information associated with them, such as a short description, similar books, published versions.
2. Bookflix allows you to publish reviews about books, and rate them, which is then stored in our own databases.
3. On Bookflix, you can follow other users to see what books they read, and be notified whenever they publish a review.

Please note that we use the Google Books API to obtain some information about books and to allow users to read them, so these features alone may not be available for all books.
